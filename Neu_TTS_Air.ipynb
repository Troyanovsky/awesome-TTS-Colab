        "\n",
        "This Colab notebook runs **NeuTTS Air**, a **super-realistic, on-device text-to-speech (TTS)** language model with **instant voice cloning**.\n",
        "Built on a **0.5B-parameter LLM backbone**, NeuTTS Air delivers **natural-sounding**, **real-time**, and **privacy-safe** speech generation—bringing high-quality voice synthesis directly to your local device.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Capabilities:**\n",
        "Real-Time On-Device Speech, Ultra-Realistic Human-Like Voices, Instant Voice Cloning (3s sample), Embedded-Optimized GGUF Format, Secure & Watermarked Output\n",

        "* 🗣 **Best-in-class realism** for its size – produces natural, expressive voices that sound genuinely human\n",
        "* 📱 **Optimized for on-device deployment** – runs locally on phones, laptops, or even Raspberry Pis via GGML\n",
        "* 🧬 **Instant voice cloning** – recreate a custom speaker from as little as 3 seconds of audio\n",
        "* 🚀 **Lightweight 0.5B architecture** – balances performance, speed, and quality for real-world TTS applications\n",
        "* 🔒 **Privacy & compliance-safe** – fully local inference with watermarked outputs\n",

        "* **Supported Language:** English\n",
        "* **Audio Codec:** NeuCodec (50 Hz neural codec, high quality at low bitrate)\n",
        "* **Context Window:** 2048 tokens (~30 seconds of audio, including prompt)\n",
        "* **Format:** GGUF (efficient on-device inference)\n",
