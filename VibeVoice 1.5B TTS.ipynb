        "- VibeVoice is a novel framework designed for generating expressive, long-form, multi-speaker conversational audio.\n",
        "- A core innovation of VibeVoice is its use of continuous speech tokenizers (Acoustic and Semantic) operating at an ultra-low frame rate of 7.5 Hz.\n",
        "- The model can synthesize speech up to 90 minutes long with up to 4 distinct speakers, surpassing the typical 1-2 speaker limits of many prior models.\n",
